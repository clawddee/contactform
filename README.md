# contactform


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot while working on this contact form, especially about hover and active states. I found it helpful to go into those topics and really work towards an understand of how they work and how it helps with user accessibility.
It was fun to work with radio buttons and create an active state that made them stand out.

I'm glad I got to work more on media queries. Responsiveness is important in design, and you can never know enough.
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

### Continued development

I really want to focus on more media queries and gain a stronger understanding of Javascript.
